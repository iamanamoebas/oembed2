The following folks and companies helped with feedback and validation of the concepts:

- [Nowork FM](http://nowork.fm) - [Itteco](http://itteco.com)'s simple intranet, we opted to build to immerse ourselves in all requirements of embeds Consumer
- Anatoly Ivanov built the 3rd reincarnation of [Iframely Open-Source Gateway](http://github.com/itteco/iframely) (we ended up releasing the 4rth incarnation of it)
- [Mathias Panzenb√∂ck](https://github.com/panzi) and [Crowdranking](http://crowdranking.com/) were the first publisher under Iframely protocol (even ahead of [us ourselves](http://iframe.ly))
- [Jon Cianciullo](https://twitter.com/jonnyjon/) helped validate some ideas.
- [Taras Kuba](https://twitter.com/taraskuba) is our brilliant designer, who added a lot of the design trends vision for future web,
- Ideas, similar to [Why Cards are the Future of the Web](http://insideintercom.io/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/) by [Paul Adams](https://twitter.com/padday)
