# Iframely Protocol for Responsive Embeds

[http://iframely.com/oembed2](http://iframely.com/oembed2)

Iframely protocol is simple publishing and discovery method for responsive embeds of web content. 

This is how it works:

- Content Publisher puts available widgets as `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of (X)HTML document. Publisher indicates MIME type of a hosted resource, sizing options and what are the expected use cases. 
- Consumer selects the widgets that work for the user's environment and app circumstances and presents it to the user. 

__Sample:__

    <link rel="iframely player"                          // list of functional use cases
          type="text/html"                               // guides to embed as iFrame
          href="//iframe.ly/bFbn"                        // with this src
          media="(min-width:100) and (min-height:100)"   // when these sizes are ok
          title="Open Web FTW!" />



Iframely protocol does not compete with specs of [oEmbed](http://oembed.com), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me) or [Twitter Cards](http://https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), but rather supplements them, as it only focuses on User Experience and not on semantic data. 


The protocol references HTML5/CSS3 and will naturally evolve with those standards from a technical standpoint.

- [EmbedLink](https://sites.google.com/site/embedlink/home) proposal by Brian Mearns was in line with what we were working on, though we don't agree that oEmbed is considered harmful, but rather a question of proper [whitelist](http://iframely.com/qa) / 2013


The following folks and companies helped with feedback and validation of the concepts:

- [Nowork FM](http://nowork.fm) - [Itteco](http://itteco.com)'s simple intranet, we opted to build to immerse ourselves in all requirements of embeds Consumer
- Anatoly Ivanov built the 3rd reincarnation of [Iframely Open-Source Gateway](http://github.com/itteco/iframely) (we ended up releasing the 4rth incarnation of it)
- [Mathias Panzenb√∂ck](https://github.com/panzi) and his [CrowdRanking](http://crowdranking.com/) was the first publisher under Iframely protocol (even ahead of [us ourselves](http://iframe.ly))
- [Jon Cianciullo](https://twitter.com/jonnyjon/) helped validate some ideas.
- [Taras Kuba](https://twitter.com/taraskuba) is our brilliant designer, who added a lot of the design trends vision for future web,
